            The specific cat sprite sheet was not made by me. It can be found free for use on itch.io.<br>
            Link to artist's page:

        <div class = "bgr1 cr3 m-3 article border border-dark">

            There are three main sections to this home page, the pixel art background, cat sprite, and html formatting. <br>
            There will be sections for each.<br>
            This is not a full guide, but provides useful guides and tips. Note that I may or may not be doing things the most efficent way possible, this is just the way I did it.

        </div>


        <div class = "bgr1 cr3 m-3 article border border-dark">
            <h3>Pixel art background</h3>
            The resources I used are as follows: <br>
            Pixel art editor: <a href="https://www.pixilart.com/draw#"> Pixilart</a> <br>
            Adobe Photoshop
            <br><br>
            As this is a tessalating pixel art, it is important to give yourself guidelines to see where you need
            parts of the art to join up<br>
            <img class= "smallimage" src="/static/projectarticleassets/homepage/guidlines.png">
            <br>
            Once you have these guidelines up, you can start making simple pixel arts of buildings and layering them.
            Keeping in mind to match the buildings with the guidelines if they ever intersect with the boundaries of the page.
            <br>
            Once you have your buildings, you can create the lit up windows.<br>
            Make sure to create these lights on a different layer. This will save alot of time later on.
            <br>
            Things to keep in mind with lights:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to keep them evenly distributed, so that density patterns dont form when the art is tessalated.</li>
                <li>Avoid putting in too many either, as if theres two many, when we add glow effects later
                    they may end up forming patterns and lines when the glow effects overlap. As humans are really sensitive to patterns,
                     it will become really clear if the image is repeated.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If these were not considered, the image may end up looking like this instead, where the repeating pattern is very clear:
            <img style="max-width:800px;max-height:200px;" src="/static/projectarticleassets/homepage/eg.png">

            <br>
            Now you have finished making the lights, make sure to export the base layer and layer with lights as seperate files.
            And open them on photoshop.
            <br>
            You will want to scale up these files, as otherwise the light effects will be pixelated.
            If you dont want a higher definition glow effect, and prefer a more pixelated style, you may skip this.<br>
            To scale up, go into image>image size, and adjust dimensions to your desire.<br>
            For pixel art make sure to select "Nearest Neighbour (hard edges)" mode, which maintains the crisp edges. Otherwise your pixel art will end up blurry <br>
            <img style="max-width:800px;max-height:200px;" src="/static/projectarticleassets/homepage/psscale.png">



            <br>
            <br>
            Now create a new project in the same dimensions you scaled up to.
            And move the base and light pictures onto this project in diffrent layers
            <br>
            There are some things to keep in mind with moving the light layer.<br>
            Because the image file of the lights is mostly empty except for the lights themselves, you cannot do
            Crtl-A then copy, because photoshop cannot handle empty borders, and will automatically crop your selection<br>
            So aligning may become tricky.<br>
            Personally I recommend putting placeholder pixels at a pair of opposite corners of the image, and then copying it across.
            <br>
            After both base layer and lights layer are on. You are ready to add the glow effects.
            <br><br>
            There are many ways to do this, but these are the two guides I followed:
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENCMGabrOcY&t=62s&pp=ygUjaG93IHRvIGFkZCBnbG93IGVmZmVjdCBpbiBwaG90b3Nob3A%3D">Glow effect guide by Benny</a>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QQxtsZ8_zQ&pp=ygUjaG93IHRvIGFkZCBnbG93IGVmZmVjdCBpbiBwaG90b3Nob3A%3D">Glow guide by Spoon graphics</a>
            <br>
            Try avoid Crtl-A then copying layers to duplicate them, as it pastes the new layer in diffrent position. Right click layer and duplicate instead.
            <br>
            <br>
            As you are trying to make a tessalating tile. having glow effects that do not line up may also be ploblemmatic.
            This does not matter too much for the glow effect that uses gaussian blur, unless you have lights right up agaist the border.
            For the glow effect using color lookup and a low flow brush, I recommend the below.
            Split the art into two sections using guides set at quarters.
            <br>
            And apply the glow effects seperately.<br>
            You would want to create two diffrent copies of: base and light layer, and the color look up layer.<br>
            For the inner section, go ahead and apply the glow effects<br>
            But prior to applying the same glow effects to the outer lights, you will want to 'transform' the image as below.
            To make sure each light effect will line up even when tessalated.
            You will want to translate each quadrant to its opposite quadrant. Eg Top Right -> Bottom left
            Below are images before and after transformation. Square is there for reference.

            <br>

            <img style="max-width:400px;max-height:400px;" src="/static/projectarticleassets/homepage/sqrframe.png">
            <img style="max-width:400px;max-height:400px;" src="/static/projectarticleassets/homepage/afterinvert.png">
            <br>
            Now when you add the glow effects for these lights, the glow effect will now line up across borders.
            Once you add them you will want to do the transformation again this time to the color lookup layer, to revert it to line up with the original image.
            <img style="max-width:400px;max-height:400px;" src="/static/glow.jpg">
            <br>
            If nothing has gone astray, your tessalating tile will have been completed.

            <h3>Sprite animation</h3>
            I did the sprite animation in js.<br>
            Recommend the following guide:<br>

            <h3>Html and page hosting</h3>
            This is the more boring technical stuff.
            There are many free hosting optinons for static pages.
            I went with github pages, which was free for anyone with an education account, which only requires one to have
            a school email and id.

            I created this project using the flask frame work.
            And used the free
            <a href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask">Frozen-Flask project</a>
            to convert the dynamic frame work to static.

            For formatting I recommend bootstrap.
